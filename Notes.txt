You and your dame got caught by the enemy. in a Market crowded with people. Harley torments your dame while, she projects a spitting image of you while you sneak away. You grab a broken black plastic basket on the way out and run. The lackeys get picked off one by one. 
You get the chance to sneak by a pillar, pull the basket over you. While a man watches out for you. The lackeys pass you by but one man, in green notices you. He grabs garbage and pour it on your back, and start pounding on your spine. The man steps forward and firidicules him, "ano, nag-aangas ka dito? Baka gusto mo ikaw tapon ko sa basurahan?"
You dare not stand up, trying to recover from the attack. The man, keeps harassing him with words until he pulls the bad guy inside the comshop, pulls out his wallet and immediately extends his time account. "Balatuan mo ko sa dota, kaya ko doblehin to." The bad guy agrees, ridiculously. You run back to your dame.
Vishnek, the earth deity...
